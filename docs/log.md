- looking at enhancer variation associated with autism 
- are fast evolving regulatory sequences related to schizophrenia / autism involved in neuron maturation rather than cell identity?
- How to assign genes to binding sites?

- Look through / work through VJ scripts

- Why is ChIP pipeline not working on some samples
It was still due to an earlier version of the pipeline.
- Run ChIP pipeline
- Run SEACR for all samples
- CutNRun DESEq

- Why is seacr  not working on bash scripts?
- CutNRun DESEq -  test per each combination - results/zic_cutnrun_deseq.Rmd
- Run MAC2 for CutNRun after exploring in the browser SEACR, MACS and MACS2 for ChIP, and macs2 really looks better than either seacr or previous call
